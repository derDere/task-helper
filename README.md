# TaskHelper

TaskHelper is a cross-platform productivity app built with [Flet](https://flet.dev) that helps you capture, prioritize and schedule tasks using an adaptive Elo-based ranking system. Instead of manually dragging tasks around, TaskHelper lets you quickly compare task importance pairwise; behind the scenes an Elo algorithm recalculates priorities so the most impactful tasks float to the top. A calendar view shows upcoming and completed work per day, while an organizer gives you fast access to adding tasks, sorting them, reviewing recently completed items, and browsing all tasks.

> Goal: Make daily task triage frictionless – add quickly, prioritize intelligently, execute confidently.
